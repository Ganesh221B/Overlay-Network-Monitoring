For bandwidth iperf is used instead of sprobe
(1) measurement of thedispersion of packet pairs and ;
(2) measurement of the variation of one-way delays versus the size of the probing packets. 
Thus, the time dispersion of the received RST packets can be used as an accurate approximation of the time dispersion of the large packet-pair that arrives at the measured host
     To estimate the bottleneck bandwidth in the opposite direction, 
The desired networking monitoring system consists of a admin server and three or more peering nodes
Finally, SmartNet requests that all interaction user-to-admin server and node-to-admin server be based on a RESTful API with JSON data encoding. Such an API should be easily testable by using HTTP(S) and the command-line utility curl, from the package libcurl.

The data is stored ina influxdb and later the data is pushed into a grafana dashboard through a python code
Grafana is used to display the data in a graphical manner where  the connected users can see the metrics.
